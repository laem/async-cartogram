Example app
---------------------
This is an example of using async-cartogram to draw a cartogram of Paris' snail neighborhoods (called "arrondissements").

React is used for the UI, and webpack for bundling.

To see the example, install grunt-cli, run `npm install`, `grunt serve` and check http://localhost:8000/.
